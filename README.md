# GorillaTag PC Modding Guide

# Setting up MonkeModManager
Here is the Install Link for MonkeModManager on GitHub
https://github.com/DeadlyKitten/MonkeModManager/releases/tag/1.3.0

Monke Mod Manager is a mod installer that will install custom mods into Gorilla Tag automatically, and can be re-run in order to update the mods. Monke Mod Manager also notifies you of any updates upon launch by opening the latest release’s page if available.

You are going to want to download and install this.

###### Note: If Windows alerts you that the file is unsafe/at risk, choose to keep/run anyway. This is a false-positive.

After you’ve downloaded Monke Mod Manager, double-click the executable to run it. By default, Monke Mod Manager should automatically fill in your Gorilla Tag installation folder.

Next, you may select any mods that are listed. BepInEx is the modloader for Gorilla Tag and cannot be unchecked. To update a mod, simply select the installed mod again. If you would like to get more information on a mod, click on it then hit the View Mod Info button.

After you select the mods you would like to install/update, hit the Install/Update button to begin the process. When the status monitor in the bottom left says “Install complete!“, you’re almost there!

If it’s your first time modding (or starting with a clean install), you’ll need to launch Gorilla Tag once and close it to initialize BepInEx. You may not see any mods load the first time you launch Gorilla Tag after modding, this is normal.
After that, re-launch Gorilla Tag and if everything went well, your mods will now load into the game. Congratulations!
